                    A great getaway for fans of rock, metal, and pinball. Yes,
                    pinball. A <span style="font-weight: heavy">lot</span> of
                    pinball. Some really cool (and sometimes obscure) movies as
                    well as records, CDs, clothes, posters. Cool place, with
                    cool people running the joint. Stop on by and plunge some
                    quarters into the pinball machines.

                    Great dive bar. Local place with local vibes where the
                    waitresses and customers all know each other. Not really a
                    sports bar - they have a jukebox and Kino playing in the
                    background. Place smells of alcohol and bartenders friend.

                    <span style="font-weight: heavy">Philly Cheese Steak</span> 
                    - "Tasted like I was back standing outside of Sunny's"
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="bold">Jalapeno Ppoppers</span> - JP's have a
                    bad rep of being nothing but microwaved frozen snacks, but
                    the JP's here are pretty good. Nice and crispy, great
                    breading, jalapeno's had a crunch, and even a touch of spice
                    to them. Might be made in-house (but are probably just a
                    really high quality premade product).

                    <span class="bold">French Onion Soup</span> - Holy crap. A
                    FOS that actually tastes like onions?! And has a boat-load
                    of onions in the bottom of the ramekin? Yes please. Again,
                    I can't tell you if this was a pre-made product or home-made
                    but I can tell you that it tasted great. If you like FOS
                    this is a must have.
